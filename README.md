## Growth mindset according to me. 
#### Growth mindset is a mindset that is not constrained or finite. Having a growth mindset means my abilities can be learned through training and practice. The growth mindset also means that I am able to learn through mistakes, trail and error, and persistance. 


1. Remember that one of the best ways to success is learning through making mistakes and that mistakes are key to the learning experience. 
2. Remember that all skills are learned with time, practice, and repitition. 
3. Embrace challenges and don't be afraid to ask questions when confused or stalled.
