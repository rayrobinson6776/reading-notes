# My Learning Journal

## Growth mindset according to me. 
#### Growth mindset is a mindset that is not constrained or finite. Having a growth mindset means my abilities can be learned through training and practice. The growth mindset also means that I am able to learn through mistakes, trail and error, and persistance. 


1. _Remember that one of the best ways to success is learning through making mistakes and that mistakes are key to the learning experience_. 
2. _Remember that all skills are learned with time, practice, and repitition_. 
3. _Embrace challenges and don't be afraid to ask questions when confused or stalled_.
